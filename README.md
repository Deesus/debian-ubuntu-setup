# Environment Setup for Ubuntu Machines:

Installs web development and machine learning packages for Ubuntu (tested on 20.0.4 and 22.04).
This is intended for local development machines; and therefore, is not suitable for servers.

### Quick Start:
1. Run `sh install_packages.sh` to install packages (n.b do not use `sudo`).
2. The `post_installation_scripts.sh` file is a guide for installing additional packages and configurations; read through the instructions (in the script file itself) to install selected packages.
